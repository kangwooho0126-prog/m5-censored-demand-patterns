# AI-Driven Slow-Moving Inventory Detection and Optimization System

##  Project Overview

This project develops an end-to-end intelligent system for detecting slow-moving and censored demand patterns and optimizing inventory policies.

It integrates:

- Feature Engineering (Statistical + Temporal Representation)
- Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means, multi-K analysis)
- Demand Pattern Recognition
- Forecasting (Baseline + Pattern-aware)
- Inventory Policy Optimization (Pattern-aware)

The goal is to transform raw sales data into actionable inventory decisions.

##  Business Problem

In supply chain management, slow-moving and intermittent demand items are difficult to manage due to:

- High demand uncertainty
- Long zero-demand periods
- Demand bursts
- Overstock and stockout risks

Traditional methods treat all SKUs similarly, leading to inefficient inventory policies.

 This project addresses:

> **How to identify demand patterns and optimize inventory decisions accordingly**

##  Solution Overview

The system follows a structured pipeline:

Sales Data
   ↓
Feature Extraction (Statistical + Temporal)
   ↓
Feature Fusion
   ↓
Clustering (Multi-K KMeans)
   ↓
Pattern Identification
   ↓
Forecasting (Baseline + Pattern-aware)
   ↓
Inventory Policy Optimization

##  Methodology

### 1. Feature Engineering
- Statistical features (mean, std, CV, zero-ratio)
- Temporal features (learned representation)
- Feature fusion (hybrid representation)

---

### 2. Clustering
- KMeans clustering (K=3~8)
- Multiple runs for stability
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Silhouette Score
  - Davies-Bouldin Index
  - Calinski-Harabasz Index

---

### 3. Pattern Recognition

Each cluster is interpreted as a demand pattern:

| Pattern       | Description |
|--------------|------------|
| Smooth       | Stable demand |
| Intermittent | Many zero-demand periods |
| Burst        | Sudden spikes |
| Volatile     | High variability |

---

### 4. Forecasting

Two approaches are compared:

- Baseline (moving average)
- Pattern-aware forecasting

Evaluation metrics:
- WAPE
- RMSE

---

### 5. Inventory Policy Optimization (Core Contribution)

A pattern-aware optimization module is introduced:

- Dynamic service level selection
- Safety stock optimization
- Reorder point calculation
- Order-up-to level optimization
- EOQ-based order quantity estimation

Different demand patterns use different cost structures:

| Pattern       | Strategy |
|--------------|--------|
| Intermittent | Conservative inventory |
| Burst        | Higher safety stock |
| Smooth       | Stable replenishment |
| Volatile     | High resilience buffer |
